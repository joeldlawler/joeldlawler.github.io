Freightwise Take Home Test

Doing research and making API calls are an important part of what we do at FreightWise.  This test will
demonstrate your abilities to:

- Make an API call
- Research an API
- Do basic DOM manipulation
- Parse data
- Handle errors
- Be creative

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.  Use a lot of comments, and explain why you are doing things.
Don't spend more than 1-2 hours on it - we aren't expecting a finished product, but it should work and look
nice.  Feel free to use any third party libraries, and if you do so, explain why you used them instead of
built in browser APIs.

Instructions:
- Use the axios (https://github.com/axios/axios) request library to make an API call to the OpenWeatherMap
  API for Current Weather Data using this API key:  25e989bd41e3e24ce13173d8126e0fd6
  We've already imported this library to get you started.
- Use either async/await or Promises.
- Get the weather for Brentwood, TN, and write it to the DOM using the `setResults` method below.  Be
  creative and make it look nice.
- Handle errors and use the `setError` method below to display the error.  Also make it look nice.
- If you find any mistakes in the test, fix them, and leave a comment about what you fixed and why.
- Make sure your code is readable and maintainable.
- Use plenty of descriptive comments.
- Make sure your code runs in the latest version of Google Chrome and Firefox (ES6 is allowed).
- Make your code live (GitHub with GitHub pages works nice).
- Send a link to your finished test to dev-team-jobs@freightwisellc.com.

Feel free to add your own twist to it (completely optional).  Here are a few ideas:
- Sign up for NewsAPI.org and get the Top Headlines and show them along with the weather.
- Use the browser location API to get the user's current location, and show that location's weather.
- Show a satellite map of the weather in Brentwood.
- Request a user's phone number and send them an SMS with the weather.
